# HTML Tag :
1) Div => tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
2) h1 => The H1 tag is an HTML heading that's most commonly used to mark up a web page title.
3) p => The HTML p element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin)
 before and after a paragraph.
4) img => used to embed an image in a web page.

# CSS Property:   

1) background-color => This property sets the background color of the HTML element.

2) display: block =>  This property determines how an element should be displayed on the webpage. In this case, the element is set to be displayed   
as a block-level element. Block-level elements typically start on a new line and take up the full width available to them, pushing any subsequent content   
onto a new line.  

3) overflow => This property controls how overflow content is displayed in the vertical  and horixonatal direction .

4) height => This property sets the height of the HTML element .  

5) width => This property sets the width of the HTML element.
   
6) position: relative => This property establishes the positioning context for the HTML element. When an element is set to position: relative;, it remains
   within the normal document flow but can be offset using the top, right, bottom, and left properties. It also serves as a reference for absolutely
   positioned child elements.

7) pseudo-elements =>  Pseudo-elements are special CSS selectors that allow you to style a specific part of an HTML element's content without the need to
   add extra HTML markup. They are denoted using the ::before and ::after keywords and can be used to insert generated content or apply styles to parts of an
   element.

8) pseudo-classes => Pseudo-classes are special CSS selectors that allow you to apply styles to specific states or conditions of HTML elements.
   They are preceded by a colon (:) and target elements based on interactions or states that cannot be targeted using normal class or ID selectors.

9) inset => The inset property is a shorthand CSS property that defines the positioning of all four sides (top, right, bottom, left) of an element
   simultaneously. It's commonly used to set the position of absolutely positioned elements within their containing elements.

10) transform => The transform property in CSS is used to apply transformations to HTML elements. Transformations alter the shape, size, and position of
    elements, often for visual effects or animations. There are various transformation functions that you can apply using the transform property.

11) background (linear gradient) => The background property in CSS is used to set the background styling of an element. One of the common uses of the
     background property is to create gradient backgrounds using the linear-gradient() function.

12) z-index => The z-index property controls the stacking order of positioned elements. It determines which elements appear in front of or behind
    others on the z-axis (depth). Higher values place elements above those with lower values.

13) box-shadow => The box-shadow property adds a shadow effect to elements.

14) margin/padding => The margin property controls the spacing outside an element. The padding property controls the spacing inside an element.
